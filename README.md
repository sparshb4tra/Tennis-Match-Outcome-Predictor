# 🎾 Tennis Match Outcome Predictor

## 🏆 Overview
The **Tennis Match Outcome Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the winner of professional ATP tennis matches based on historical data. The dataset, sourced from **Jeff Sackmann's "tennis_atp"** repository, includes detailed match statistics such as player rankings, surface types, match duration, aces, and break points saved.

🚧 **Work in Progress:** The model is currently in training, and we are refining features and optimizing performance!

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical ATP match records, containing:
- **Player Information**: Winner & Loser names, rankings, and handedness.
- **Match Statistics**: Aces, double faults, service points, and break points saved.
- **Surface Details**: Clay, Grass, and Hard court surfaces.
- **Tournament Info**: Round, match duration, and event details.

## 🏗️ Project Pipeline
🔹 **Data Loading**: Importing ATP match data from CSV files.
🔹 **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding player performance, surface impact, and key match trends.
🔹 **Feature Engineering**: Creating new predictive features like rank difference and ace percentage.
🔹 **Model Training**: Training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
🔹 **Evaluation & Optimization**: Tuning hyperparameters and improving accuracy.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our EDA uncovers key insights such as:
- 🎾 **Impact of Surface Type**: Does a player's performance vary on Clay vs. Grass?
- 📊 **Ranking vs. Win Rate**: Do higher-ranked players always dominate?
- ⚡ **Aces & Match Outcome**: Does serving power influence match results?

---

## 🔮 Next Steps
🔹 Fine-tune models for improved accuracy.
🔹 Implement deep learning approaches (LSTMs, Neural Networks).
🔹 Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions.
